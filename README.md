# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mubarak Adebayo Mustapha (aka MubrexNode01)

Cloud Architect, Backend Software Engineer, Security Architect, and DevOps Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub space. Iâ€™m Mubarak, and Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve real problemsâ€”especially those facing Africa. My work brings together cloud computing, backend development, security, and DevOps to build scalable and secure solutions that make a difference.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into cloud-native architectures, backend systems, and cybersecurity. I love exploring how these fields overlap to tackle challenges both globally and locally. My goal is to empower people and communities by creating technology thatâ€™s reliable, secure, and impactful.

I work a lot with AWS, and Iâ€™m looking forward to adding Azure to my toolkit soon. Iâ€™m very comfortable with Linux, Python, networking, SQL, and data analytics. DevOps is a big part of my processâ€”I love using CI/CD pipelines and containerization to build and deploy reliable systems.

Security is always a top priority for me. I pay close attention to threat modeling, vulnerability assessments, and secure coding practices to make sure solutions are resilient and trustworthy.

Collaboration and empathy matter just as much as technical expertise. I believe in clear communication, first principles thinking, and putting people at the heart of every project.

If youâ€™re interested in DevOps, cloud engineering, backend solutions, or building resilient systems, check out my featured project:

[ALX System Engineering DevOps](https://github.com/MubrexNode01/alx-system_engineering-devops)  
This repository documents my growth as a technologist and showcases my work in DevOps, cloud, and backend engineering for Africa.

Iâ€™m always learning; whether itâ€™s about distributed systems, security best practices, automation, or using software engineering for social impact. Open source and tech for good really motivate me.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I love reading, traveling, playing football, and discovering new tech ideas.

Technology is a catalyst for change. Letâ€™s build a smarter, safer, and more inclusive future for Africa and the world.
